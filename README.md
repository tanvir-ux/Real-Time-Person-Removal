# Disappearing-People - Person removal from complex backgrounds over time.
Removing people from complex backgrounds in real time using TensorFlow.js in the web browser using JavaScript.
Just like Hollow Man movie but in real.

## What can this do?

This code attempts to learn over time the makeup of the background of a video such that I can attempt to remove any humans from the scene. This is all happening in real time, in the browser, using TensorFlow.js. #MadeWithTFJS 

This is an experiment. It may not be perfect in all situations.
You must enable webcam in the browser.
